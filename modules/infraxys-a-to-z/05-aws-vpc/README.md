# Infraxys A to Z: 05 - Create a VPC in AWS

For the coming examples, we'll need a VPC prepared.

Please follow the instructions in [AWS VPC](/modules/environments/VPC/README.md) to do so.

## Prerequisites

Executed the [Multiple inheritance with packets and optional action generation](../03-multiple-inheritance-with-packets-and-conditional-actions/README.md)-example.
We'll need the VPC, so don't remove it if you want to continue with the coming examples.
